This is a simple JS fun game of rolling dice and random numbers generated for each player. The player that scores 100 or more becomes the winner. 
when a dice is rolled and the user wants to keep/hold the score of the dice then the hold button is clicked which then allows the other player to play.
When a player rolls a 1 then all the previous tally of dice rolled which haven't been held would be lost.
